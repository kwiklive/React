## How does React Work?
Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM (copy of the actual DOM) in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.

React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed.
